Outgoing stamped mail (envelopes, not packages) can also be sent through these mailboxes, using the slot labeled \u201cOutgoing Mail.\u201d A key with a plastic rectangular key fob in your mailbox indicates that USPS has delivered a small package to you. Use the key to open the large door of the mailbox bank and retrieve your package. The key will automatically lock in the door, and a postal carrier will retrieve it.
